### EXAMPLE_HIGH
Section 1 – Knowledge of Disorders and Symptoms
1.1 What is a psychological disorder?
A psychological disorder is a clinically significant pattern of cognition, emotion regulation or behaviour that reflects dysfunction in psychological, biological or developmental processes and produces distress or impairment (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013).
1.2 Symptom categorisation
Everyday / low-impact experiences (no major impairment)	Disorder-linked symptoms (cause impairment)
Sneaker reselling as a side hobby	Repeated deceit for profit (hacking canteen, sneaker scam)
Ambition to sit courtside at basketball	Persistent grandiose self-image (“own the class”, “front row autograph”)
Enjoyment of coding	Trespass and property damage during “urban exploration”
Competitive rugby play	Physical aggression (elbowing winger post-whistle)
Occasional late-night planning	Consistent lack of remorse (“teachers are clueless”, “prove it”)
Why?
The left column activities are legal or socially typical and do not substantially limit Callum’s functioning. The right column behaviours breach others’ rights or school rules, trigger suspensions, legal cautions and peer alienation, demonstrating functional impairment (APA, 2013).
1.3 Biological, Psychological & Social (B-P-S) factors
Biological – Callum’s impulsivity and sensation-seeking may be partly heritable (father’s juvenile theft, possible low serotonergic regulation). Mild head injury (concussion) can further lower inhibition thresholds.
Psychological – Core entitlement schema (“system is there to beat”), externalisation of blame, and thrill-seeking reinforce antisocial acts. Absence of guilt blocks corrective learning.
Social – Permissive parenting (“we covered the damages”), peer reinforcement for risk videos, and online clout culture normalise rule-breaking. These social contingencies interact with impulsive temperament to stabilise the antisocial pattern.
________________________________________
Section 2 – Applying Diagnostic Criteria
2.1 Core symptoms used for diagnosis
•	Deceitfulness for personal gain (canteen hack, tool theft, sneaker scalping).
•	Impulsivity and failure to plan ahead (late-night street races, helmet-free crash).
•	Irritability and aggressiveness (punch-up, rugby elbow).
•	Reckless disregard for safety of self/others (angle-grinder guard removal, motorbike races).
•	Consistent lack of remorse (laughs when confronted, “prove it”).
•	Conduct problems before age 15 (school hacking, theft).
2.2 Duration
Conduct-like behaviours are documented across two academic years (suspension “last term”, current warehouse trespass). This exceeds the 12-month minimum for Antisocial Personality Disorder and satisfies “pervasive pattern” (APA, 2013).
2.3 Most likely disorder – Antisocial Personality Disorder (provisional)
Callum meets ≥ 3 DSM-5 criteria for ASPD, with evidence across school, home and community. Age criterion (≥ 18) is met in six months; DSM allows provisional diagnosis when conduct disorder traits persist into late adolescence.
2.4 Second most likely disorder – Narcissistic Personality Disorder
Grandiosity, need for admiration and exploitation suggest NPD, but antisocial violations dominate the presentation and drive impairment (legal trouble > ego injury). NPD therefore ranks second.
________________________________________
Section 3 – Treatment Plan
3.1 Approach – Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with Offence-Focused Modules (CBT-A) augmented by Multisystemic Therapy (MST).
3.2 Administration
•	CBT-A: Weekly 60-min individual sessions for 20 weeks targeting cognitive distortions (“winners deserve the prize”), anger cues and problem-solving. Includes victim-empathy role-plays.
•	MST: Therapist works with family and school for 4–6 months, setting clear contingencies (immediate loss of motorbike keys after infractions) and coaching parents on consistent limits.
•	School adds a behaviour contract plus token reward for pro-social acts; legal liaison monitors compliance. Medication not indicated unless future comorbid ADHD/irritability emerges.
3.3 Symptom reduction rationale
CBT-A restructures entitlement beliefs and builds future-orientation, directly addressing deceitfulness and impulsivity. Anger-management modules decrease aggression in rugby and peer disputes. MST aligns home and school responses, reducing reinforcement of thrill-seeking. Empathy training plus real-life restitution targets his remorse deficit.

### EXAMPLE_LOW
Section 1
Definition
A psychological disorder is when feelings or behaviour get so extreme they bother the person and mess with normal life (APA, 2013).
Normal vs non-normal
•	Normal things: likes coding; selling shoes; wants to be rich; plays rugby; stays up late sometimes.
•	Not normal: keeps hacking, steals tools, bashes kids, races bikes without helmet, brags no remorse.
Reasoning – Selling shoes is legal, but hacking and stealing are crimes and get him suspended, so they affect functioning.
B/P/S
•	Bio – Dad had trouble as a teen, maybe genes for risk-taking.
•	Psy – Thinks rules don’t apply, high sensation seeking.
•	Social – Friends hype him up online, parents cover damages so no consequences.
________________________________________
Section 2
Core symptoms
Lies for profit, aggressive fights, risky stunts, little guilt.
Duration
Stuff happened last term and now, at least 6 months.
Main diagnosis
Antisocial Personality Disorder (provisional) because he breaks rules, hurts people and doesn’t care.
Second choice
Narcissistic Personality because he’s full of himself, but antisocial fits better. Not schizophrenia etc.
________________________________________
Section 3
Treatment
Do Cognitive Behaviour Therapy once a week to learn empathy and better choices. Family should back this up with rewards for good behaviour. Might need meds later if he gets angry all the time.
How it helps – CBT shows him the damage he causes and gives thinking steps before acting, so fewer fights and hacking.
