### SYSTEM
You are a strict marker for Year-10 Psychology case-study tasks. You will analyze the student's submission against a detailed rubric. Your task is to assess each criterion, assign a band from 1 to 5, and provide a concise rationale for your decision.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1.  Read the student's submission carefully.
2.  For each of the six grading criteria, determine the most appropriate band (1-5) based on the rubric.
3.  For each criterion, provide:
    - `criterion`: The unique ID for the criterion (e.g., `symptom_analysis`).
    - `band`: The integer band you have assigned (1-5).
    - `evidence`: One or two direct quotes from the submission that best justify your assigned band.
    - `rationale`: A brief explanation of why this band was chosen. State what the student did well and what was missing for the next band. **IMPORTANT: If your rationale includes double quotes, you MUST escape them with a backslash, like this: \"example\"**.
4.  Output **only** the YAML below inside a fenced code block (` ```yaml ... ``` `). Do not include any other text, greetings, or explanations outside the YAML block.

### EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT
```yaml
assistant_reasons:
  - criterion: symptom_analysis
    evidence: "A psychological disorder is a clinically significant pattern of cognition, emotion regulation or behaviour that reflects dysfunction..."
    band: 5
    rationale: "The student precisely defined the term and correctly classified over 5 normal and pathological experiences with clear justification, meeting all top-band anchors."
  - criterion: bps_factors
    evidence: "These social contingencies interact with impulsive temperament to stabilise the antisocial pattern."
    band: 5
    rationale: "Excellent work linking all three B-P-S factors and explaining their interaction, rather than just listing them."
  - criterion: diagnostic_primary
    evidence: "Callum meets ≥ 3 DSM-5 criteria for ASPD, with evidence across school, home and community."
    band: 4
    rationale: "Accurate diagnosis and good justification. To reach the top band, the student needed to more explicitly map *all* relevant DSM-5 criteria to evidence from the text."
  - criterion: diagnostic_diff
    evidence: "NPD therefore ranks second."
    band: 3
    rationale: "A plausible secondary disorder was named, but the comparison was limited. A stronger response would have detailed why ASPD is a better fit than NPD, using evidence to rule out NPD."
  - criterion: treatment
    evidence: "CBT-A restructures entitlement beliefs and builds future-orientation, directly addressing deceitfulness and impulsivity."
    band: 5
    rationale: "A detailed, evidence-based plan is provided with clear links between the treatment components and the specific symptoms they target."
  - criterion: communication
    evidence: "The entire submission."
    band: 4
    rationale: "The work is well-structured and mostly clear, with only minor referencing issues. Meets the 'B' grade criteria for communication."

Section 1: The Disorder and its Factors
A psychological disorder is a pattern of behaviour that causes significant distress and impairment in a person's life. For Sam, many of his actions go beyond normal teenage behaviour.
Normal vs. Pathological Symptoms:
Normal: Enjoying video games, having a messy room, sometimes arguing with parents.
Pathological: Believing streetlights are morse code, hearing voices, isolating from friends, grades dropping from A to C.
The pathological symptoms are a problem because they affect his school work and social life.
B-P-S Factors:
Sam's problems are caused by a mix of factors. Biologically, his sleep is disturbed, and he has low energy. Psychologically, he has delusions about codes and seems paranoid. Socially, he is withdrawing from his friends and football, which used to be important to him. These all interact; for example, his psychological paranoia makes him isolate socially, and his lack of sleep (biological) likely worsens his thinking.
Section 2: Diagnosis
The most likely diagnosis for Sam is Schizophrenia. He shows key symptoms like delusions ("streetlights flash in morse code"), hallucinations ("numbers rearranging on the page"), and disorganized speech (speaking rapidly and off-topic). These symptoms have been present for over a month and are causing a major decline in his functioning, which fits the DSM-5 criteria.
A differential diagnosis could be Bipolar I Disorder because of his high energy spikes and rapid speech, which could be part of a manic episode. However, the psychotic symptoms like delusions seem to be constant and not just during mood episodes, which makes Schizophrenia a better fit.
Section 3: Treatment
A good treatment plan would be to use antipsychotic medication to help control the hallucinations and delusions. This is the first-line treatment. He should also start Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp) to help him understand and manage his symptoms. Family therapy would also be important to help his parents support him effectively. This combination addresses the biological and psychosocial aspects of his disorder.

assistant_reasons:
  - criterion: symptom_analysis
    evidence: "The pathological symptoms are a problem because they affect his school work and social life."
    band: 4
    rationale: "Good separation of symptoms and a clear link to functional impairment. To reach the top band, a more precise, textbook definition of a psychological disorder was needed at the start."
  - criterion: bps_factors
    evidence: "These all interact; for example, his psychological paranoia makes him isolate socially, and his lack of sleep (biological) likely worsens his thinking."
    band: 4
    rationale: "The student correctly identified factors in all three domains and provided a clear example of their interaction. The analysis could be deeper but meets all requirements for a B-grade."
  - criterion: diagnostic_primary
    evidence: "He shows key symptoms like delusions ('streetlights flash in morse code'), hallucinations ('numbers rearranging on the page')... which fits the DSM-5 criteria."
    band: 4
    rationale: "A correct diagnosis is made with strong evidence cited from the text. The justification is good but doesn't map to the DSM-5 criteria as methodically as a top-band response would."
  - criterion: diagnostic_diff
    evidence: "However, the psychotic symptoms like delusions seem to be constant and not just during mood episodes, which makes Schizophrenia a better fit."
    band: 4
    rationale: "Excellent work. A plausible differential (Bipolar I) was identified and correctly ruled out with a concise, evidence-based reason. This is strong B-grade reasoning."
  - criterion: treatment
    evidence: "A good treatment plan would be to use antipsychotic medication... He should also start Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp)."
    band: 4
    rationale: "The student proposed appropriate, evidence-based treatments (medication and CBTp). The justification is clear but could be more detailed in linking specific treatment components to specific symptoms."
  - criterion: communication
    evidence: "The entire submission."
    band: 3
    rationale: "The structure is adequate and the writing is clear, but the referencing is minimal ('DSM-5'). A more formal reference list and in-text citations were needed for a higher band."
